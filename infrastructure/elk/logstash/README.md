### Logstash Overview and Flow

Logstash is an open-source data processing pipeline that ingests, transforms, and sends data to a destination. It is part of the Elastic Stack (ELK Stack) and is often used to process logs, metrics, and other types of data before forwarding them to Elasticsearch for storage and analysis.

### **Logstash Flow**

1.  **Input**: Specifies where the data comes from.
2.  **Filter**: Defines how the data is transformed or enriched.
3.  **Output**: Determines where the processed data is sent.

In your configuration:

#### Input Section:


`input {     beats {         port => 5044     }      tcp {         port => 50000     } }`

*   **`beats` Input Plugin**:

    *   Accepts data from Beats (like Filebeat, Metricbeat, etc.) on port `5044`.
    *   Used when agents like Filebeat forward logs to Logstash.
*   **`tcp` Input Plugin**:

    *   Accepts data over TCP connections on port `50000`.
    *   Typically used for custom applications or devices that send log data directly over TCP.

#### Filter Section:


`## Add your filters / logstash plugins configuration here`

*   Filters process and transform the incoming data.
*   Common tasks:
    *   Parsing logs (e.g., extracting fields from unstructured logs).
    *   Adding or modifying fields.
    *   Converting data formats (e.g., JSON, XML).
    *   Dropping unwanted logs.

**Popular Filter Plugins**:

*   **`grok`**: Pattern matching for parsing structured and unstructured logs.
*   **`mutate`**: Modify fields (e.g., rename, remove, update).
*   **`date`**: Parse timestamps and convert them to a standard format.
*   **`json`**: Parse JSON-encoded logs into structured fields.
*   **`geoip`**: Add geographic information based on IP addresses.

Example Filter:


`filter {     grok {         match => { "message" => "%{TIMESTAMP_ISO8601:timestamp} %{LOGLEVEL:level} %{GREEDYDATA:log_message}" }     }      date {         match => ["timestamp", "ISO8601"]     }      mutate {         remove_field => ["host", "port"]  # Remove unnecessary fields     } }`

#### Output Section:


`output {     elasticsearch {         hosts => "elasticsearch:9200"         user => "logstash_internal"         password => "${LOGSTASH_INTERNAL_PASSWORD}"     } }`

*   **`elasticsearch` Output Plugin**:
    *   Sends processed data to Elasticsearch at `elasticsearch:9200`.
    *   Uses a specific username (`logstash_internal`) and password to authenticate. The password is referenced from an environment variable (`LOGSTASH_INTERNAL_PASSWORD`).

* * *

### **Filter Flow**

1.  **Data Ingestion**:

    *   Logstash receives raw data from the defined `input` plugins.
2.  **Transformation**:

    *   Data passes through the `filter` plugins in the order specified in the configuration file.
    *   Each plugin applies its transformation. For example:
        *   `grok` extracts specific fields from log messages.
        *   `mutate` modifies or removes unnecessary fields.
        *   `geoip` adds location metadata.
3.  **Conditional Logic**:

    *   Filters can include conditions to apply transformations only to specific logs.

    `if [loglevel] == "ERROR" {     mutate { add_field => { "alert" => "true" } } }`

4.  **Structured Output**:

    *   After filtering, the logs are transformed into structured JSON, ready for storage or analysis.

### **Complete Logstash Data Flow**

1.  **Input**: Logstash listens for data (e.g., Beats on port 5044 or TCP on port 50000).
2.  **Filter**: Processes and enriches the logs:
    *   Extract fields, normalize data, add metadata, or remove unwanted parts.
3.  **Output**: Sends the transformed logs to the destination (e.g., Elasticsearch).
